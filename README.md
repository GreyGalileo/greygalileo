## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Galileo Grey, a 3rd year undergraduate student studying pure mathematics at UniversitÃ© Grenoble Alpes.
I upload personal projects (like my personal website/portfolio) on github, as well as various projects from courses I've taken or from internships I've done.
I have research experience with finite fields as well as elementary numerical analysis through internships I've done at laboratories in my university.
I'm interested in pursuing research related to algebra and topology.
